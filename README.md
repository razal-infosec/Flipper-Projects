#🔐 Flipper Zero Security Research & Pentesting Projects#
Welcome to my Flipper Zero Security Research & Pentesting Projects repository! 🚀 Here, I document my offensive security experiments, focusing on Wi-Fi, RFID, NFC, and other wireless attack vectors using Flipper Zero and additional hardware like the Wi-Fi Devboard.

📌 About This Repository
This repository is a collection of hands-on penetration testing projects performed using Flipper Zero and other cybersecurity tools. Each project includes:
✅ Attack methodology & steps
✅ Screenshots & proof of execution
✅ Observations & results
✅ Mitigation strategies

🛠️ Tools & Hardware Used
Flipper Zero (Multi-tool for security research)
Wi-Fi Devboard (ESP32-based module for wireless attacks)
Leyditr Firmware (Custom firmware for advanced Flipper capabilities)
Aircrack-ng (Wi-Fi pentesting suite)
Kali Linux / Parrot OS (Security-focused OS for testing)
🚀 Projects
1️⃣ Wi-Fi Deauthentication Attack (Completed ✅)
📌 Overview: Performed a Wi-Fi deauth attack on a mobile hotspot (Test Device-ios) using Flipper Zero & Wi-Fi Devboard. The attack resulted in a Windows PC losing internet connectivity, proving the effectiveness of the technique.
